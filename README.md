# Slot machine (Vue js, scss)

The project was made according to the technical task. There were no specific design requirements, but to create maximum visual recognition of the slot machine, I used a color scheme that is relevant for such applications. The design was invented along the way.

Attributes of height and width have been added to the images of the slots to prevent cumulative layout shift problems(lighthouse) and UX.

The reel initially contains 12 elements for a beautiful and smooth animation.
Important date added to constants.

Images were optized at squosh.

At constants i have used "isBar" for reel because it has only 2 types(bar, not bar), in real-world app i would check by type or smt
